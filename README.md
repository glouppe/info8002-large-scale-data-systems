## Projects

### Programming project

KeyChain. Due by **December 21, 2018 at 23:59**. See the [`/project/`](https://github.com/glouppe/info8002-large-scale-data-systems/tree/master/project) folder for instructions.

### Reading assignment

Your task is to read and summarize a major scientific paper that concerns a large-scale data system.

> Paper: "Spanner: Google’s Globally-Distributed Database"<br>
> James C. Corbett et al, 2012. [[PDF](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/39966.pdf)]

Additional resources: [Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Spanner, TrueTime and the CAP theorem](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/45855.pdf).

You should produce a report that summarizes the problem that is tackled by the paper and explains why it is challenging or important. The report should outline the main contributions and results with respect to the problem that is addressed.
It should also include a critical discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of the solution. In particular, you should discuss how Spanner fit in the context of the [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem).
Whenever possible, try to relate the content of the paper to the concepts introduced in the course.

Constraints:
- English
- Up to 4 pages
- Formatted using the LaTeX template [`template-report-reading-assignment.tex`](https://glouppe.github.io/info8002-large-scale-data-systems/template-report-reading-assignment.tex)
- You are allowed to complete the project by yourself, or in groups with a maximum of 3 students.

Your report should be submitted  by **December 21, 2018 at 23:59** on the [submission platform](https://submit.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/). This is a **hard** deadline.

#### Overleaf

For those not familiar with LaTeX, you can easily write your report using Overleaf. For example by making a copy of [the following project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gvzynxgcpbwf).
