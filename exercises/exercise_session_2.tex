\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Broadcast communication is used to disseminate information among a set of processes and differ according to the reliability of the dissemination.  In a traditional \emph{server-client} architecture, interactions are often established between two processes. In this architecture, a server exposes some kind of interface to the client, which in turn employs this interface to synchronize the state with all other participating clients (e.g., as in a multiplayer game). These interactions are supported by a \emph{direct link} between the server and all its clients.
