# Philosophy

## Solid ground

- Understand the *foundational principles* of distributed systems, including *databases* and *computing* systems.

## Practical

- Exposition to industrial software.
- Fun and challenging course project.

## Critical thinking

- Assess the benefits and disadvantages of distributed systems.
- No hype!
