# Large-scale Distributed Systems

Lecture 3: Reliable broadcast

---

# Today

- How do you talk to **multiple machines** at once?
- What if some of them *fail*?
- Can we guarantee that correct nodes all receive the same messages?
- What about **ordering**?
- What about *performance*?

# Unreliable broadcast

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec3/unreliable-broadcast.png)]

Constraints:
- The sender may fail.
- Recipients may fail.
- Packets might get lost.
- Packets may take long to travel.

How do we define a *reliable* broadcast service?


???

Correct nodes do not have the same view of the system:
- $p_2$ and $p_4$ delivered
- but $p_3$ did not.

# Reliable broadcast abstractions

- *Best-effort broadcast*
    - Guarantees reliability only if sender is correct.
- *Reliable broadcast*
    - Guarantees reliability independent of whether sender is correct.
- *Uniform reliable broadcast*
    - Also considers the behavior of failed nodes.
- *Causal reliable broadcast*
    - Reliable broadcast with causal delivery order.

- Best-effort broadcast gives no guarantees if *sender crashes*.
- **Reliable broadcast**:
    - Same as best-effort broadcast +

# Uniform reliable broadcast

- Assume sender broadcasts a message
    - Sender fails
    - No correct node delivers the message
    - Failed nodes deliver the message
- Is this OK?
- **Uniform** reliable broadcast ensures that if a message is delivered (by a correct *or faulty* process), then all correct processes deliver.

???

R: improve the motivation.

# Implementations

# Basic broadcast

.center[![](figures/lec3/beb-impl.png)]

Correctness:
- *BEB1. Validity*: If a correct process $p$ broadcasts $m$, then every correct process eventually delivers $m$.
    - If sender does not crash, every other correct node receives message by perfect channels.
- *BEB2+3. No duplication + no creation*
    - Guaranteed by perfect channels.

---

# Lazy reliable broadcast

- Assume a *fail-stop* distributed system model.
    - i.e., crash-stop processes, perfect links and a perfect failure detector.
- To broadcast $m$:
    - best-effort broadcast $m$
    - Upon `bebDeliver`:
        - Save message
        - `rbDeliver` the message
- If sender $s$ crashes, detect and relay messages from $s$ to all.
    - case 1: get $m$ from $s$, detect crash of $s$, redistribute $m$
    - case 2: detect crash of $s$, get $m$ from $s$, redistribute $m$.
- Filter duplicate messages.

# Correctness of LRB

Correctness:
- *RB1-RB3*
    - Satisfied with best-effort broadcast.
- *RB4. Agreement*: If a message $m$ is delivered by some correct process, then $m$ is eventually delivered by every correct process.
    - When correct $p_j$ delivers $m$ broadcast by $p_i$
        - if $p_i$ is correct, BEB ensures correct delivery
        - if $p_i$ crashes,
            - $p_j$ detects this (because of completeness of the PFD)
            - $p_j$ uses BEB to ensure (BEB1) every correct node gets $m$.

---

# Eager reliable broadcast

- What happens if we use instead an *eventually* perfect failure detector?
    - Only affects performance, not correctness.
- Can we modify Lazy RB to not use a perfect failure detector?
    - Assume all nodes have failed.
    - BEB broadcast all received messages.

# Eager reliable broadcast

.center[![](figures/lec3/erb-impl.png)]

<span class="Q">[Q]</span> Show that eager reliable broadcast is correct.

---

# Uniformity

Neither Lazy RB nor Eager RB ensure *uniform* agreement.
- E.g., sender $p$ immediately RB delivers and crashes. Only $p$ delivered the message.

## Strategy for uniform agreement
- Before delivering a message, we need to ensure all correct nodes have received it.
- Messages are  **pending** until all correct nodes get it.
    - Collect acknowledgements from nodes that got the message.
- Deliver once all correct nodes acked.

# Correctness of All-ack URB

## Lemma
If a correct node $p$ BEB delivers $m$, then $p$ eventually URB delivers $m$.

Proof:
- A correct node $p$ BEB broadcasts $m$ as soon as it gets $m$.
- By BEB1, every correct node gets $m$ and BEB broadcasts $m$.
- Therefore $p$ BEB delivers from every correct node by BEB1.
- By completeness of the perfect failure detector, $p$ will not wait for dead nodes forever.
    - `canDeliver` becomes true and $p$ URB delivers $m$.

---

# Correctness of All-ack URB

- *URB1. Validity*: If a correct process $p$ broadcasts $m$, then $p$ delivers $m$
    - If sender is correct, it will BEB delivers $m$ by validity (BEB1)
    - By the lemma, it will therefore eventually URB delivers $m$.
- *URB2. No duplication*
    - Guaranteed because of the `delivered` set.
- *URB3. No creation*
    - Ensured from best-effort broadcast.
- *URB4. Uniform agreement*: If a message $m$ is delivered by some process (correct or faulty), then $m$ is eventually delivered by every correct process
    - Assume some node (possibly failed) URB delivers $m$.
        - Then `canDeliver` was true, and by accuracy of the failure detector, every correct node has BEB delivered $m$.
    - By the lemma, each of the nodes that BEB delivered $m$ will URB deliver $m$.

---

# URB for fail-silent

- All-ack URB requires a perfect failure detector (fail-stop).
- Can we implement URB in *fail-silent*,  without a perfect failure detector?
- **Yes**, provided a majority of nodes are correct.

# Causal reliable broadcast

---

# Motivation

.center[![](figures/lec3/tweet-difficult.png)]

Reliable broadcast:
- Exactly-once delivery: *guaranteed* by the properties of RB.
- Order of message? **Not guaranteed!**

<span class="Q">[Q]</span> Does uniform reliable broadcast remedy this?

???

No, uniform agreement only concerns individual messages.

---

# Causal order of messages

.center[![](figures/lec3/causal-order.png)]

A message $m_1$ may have caused another message $m_2$, denoted $m_1 \to m_2$ if any of the following relations apply:

- (a) some process $p$ broadcasts $m_1$ before it broadcasts $m_2$;
- (b) some process $p$ delivers $m_1$ and subsequently broadcasts $m_2$; or
- (c) there exists some message $m'$ such that $m_1 \to m'$ and $m' \to m_2$.

# No-waiting CB example

.center[![](figures/lec3/nwcrb-example.png)]

- The size of the message **grows with time**, as messages include their list of
causally preceding messages `mpast`.
- Solution 1: *Garbage collect* old messages by sending acknowledgements of delivery to all nodes and purging messages that have been acknowledged from all.
- Solution 2: History is a *vector timestamp*!

# Probabilistic broadcast

a.k.a. epidemic broadcast or gossip

# Scalability of reliable broadcast

- In order to broadcast a message, the sender needs
    - to send messages to all other processes,
    - to collect some form of acknowledgement.
    - $O(N^2)$ are exchanged in total.
        - If $N$ is large, this can become overwhelming for the system.  
- Bandwidth, memory or processing resources may limit the number of messages/acknowledgements that may be sent/collected.
- Hierarchical schemes reduce the total number of messages.
    - This reduces the load of each process.
    - But increases the latency and fragility of the system.

.center.width-100[![](figures/lec3/comm-acks.png)]

---

# Epidemic dissemination

- Nodes infect each other through messages sent in **rounds**.
    - The *fanout* $k$ determines the number of messages sent by each node.
    - Recipients are drawn *at random* (e.g., uniformally).
    - The *number of rounds* is limited to $R$.
- Total number of messages is usually less than $O(N^2)$.
- No node is overloaded.

# The mathematics of epidemics

- Assume an initial population of $N$ individuals.
- At any time $t$,
    - $S(t) =$ the number of *susceptible* individuals,
    - $I(t) =$ the number of *infected* individuals.
- $I(0) = 1$
- $S(0) = N-1$
- $S(t)+I(t)=N$ for all $t$.

???

R: assume we are a virus using a distributed system with human hosts as nodes.

---

# The mathematics of epidemics

The dynamics of the SIS model is given as follows:
$$S(t+1) = S(t) - \frac{\alpha \Delta t}{N} S(t) I(t) + \gamma \Delta t I(t)$$
$$I(t+1) = I(t) + \frac{\alpha \Delta t}{N} S(t) I(t) - \gamma \Delta t I(t)$$
where
- $\alpha$ is the contact rate with whom infected individuals make contact per unit of time.
- $\frac{S(t)}{N}$ is the proportion of contacts with susceptible individuals for each infected individual.
- $\gamma$ is the probability for an infected individual to recover and switch to the pool of susceptibles.

$N=1000000$, $\alpha=5$, $\gamma=0.5$, $\Delta t = 0.1$

---

# The mathematics of epidemics

In eager reliable broadcast,
- $\alpha = k$
    - An infected node selects $k$ nodes among $N$ to send its messages.
- $\gamma = 1$
    - An infected node immediately recovers.

---

# Probabilistic validity

At time $t$, the probability of not receiving a message is
$$(1 - \frac{k}{N})^{i(t)}$$
Therefore the probability of having received of one or more gossip messages up to time $t$, that is to have PB-delivered, is
$$p(\text{delivery}) = 1 - (1 - \frac{k}{N})^{\sum_{t_i=0}^t i(t_i)}$$

<span class="Q">[Q]</span> What if nodes fail? if packets are loss?

???

- Node failures: replace $N$ with $N/2$ and $k$ with $k/2$.
- Packet loss: replace $k$ with $k/2$.

# Probabilistic validity

From this plot, we observe that:
- Within only a few rounds (*low latency*), a large fraction of nodes receive the message (*reliability*)
- Each node has transmitted no more than $kR$ messages (*lightweight*).

---

# Lazy Probabilistic broadcast

- Eager probabilistic broadcast consumes **considerable resources** and causes many **redundant transmissions**.
    - in particular as $r$ gets larger and almost all nodes have received the message once.
- Assume *a stream of messages* to be broadcast.
- Broadcast messages in **two phases**:
    - *Phase 1 (data dissemination)*: run probabilistic broadcast with a large probability $\epsilon$ that reliable delivery fails. That is, assume a constant fraction of nodes obtain the message (e.g., $\frac{1}{2}$).
    - *Phase 2 (recovery)*: upon delivery, detect omissions through sequence numbers and initiate retransmissions with gossip.
